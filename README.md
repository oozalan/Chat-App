It was made as a project for CSE4074 Computer Networks course with a group of 3 students.

## How to Use
To be able to use the program, computers must be connected to the same local network.
One of the computers in the network must be the server by executing the registry.py
file. The server_ip value in the peer.py file must be configured accordingly. The server
only connects the computers to each other. After that, communication happens as peer-to-peer.   

Other computers must execute the peer.py file to communicate with others. This file can
also be executed on the server computer in a different terminal window.   

After these steps, the users can start communicate with each other by using the command line interface.
